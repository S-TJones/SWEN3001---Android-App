# SWEN3001---Android-App
This is an Android Application developed by the group JHS Collaborate for the course SWEN3001 (Android Application Development).

# App Description
Task Management App: Due to the quarantine effect, many people have gotten quite lazy. And it may not be easy for everyone to adjust to the online environment. To maintain a healthy lifestyle and still keep up with daily activities, we decided to create an app that acts as a personal assistant. It helps with keeping track of TODOs for someone with an active lifestyle. It would include timers, stopwatches, alarms and reminders. This ensures that one doesn't forget to do what they need to do and when they should do it.
